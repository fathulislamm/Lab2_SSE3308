           <p>
             I am a second-year Software Engineering student at Universiti Putra Malaysia, currently pursuing my degree with a strong academic record and consistent Deanâ€™s List recognition. I am a Yayasan Bank Rakyat scholar, which reflects my dedication to both academic excellence and community contribution. With a passion for solving problems through technology, I enjoy turning ideas into functional and engaging digital experiences.
           </p>
           <p>
             Beyond the classroom, I actively pursue creative outlets such as photography and performing arts, where I recently earned second place in an intercollege theatre competition. I own a camera and enjoy capturing moments from outdoor adventures, campus events, and nature. These experiences have helped me build confidence, communication skills, and a sharp eye for aesthetics.
           </p>
           <p>
             In the long term, I aim to become a well-rounded software engineer who can contribute to impactful tech solutions while embracing creativity and collaboration. I believe that technical knowledge paired with storytelling, design, and leadership can make a real difference in the world. My goal is to continuously grow, learn, and contribute meaningfully through both code and creativity.
